Applications of bfs:

1. Shortest Path in an unweighted graph
2. Crawlers in search engine
3. Peer to Peer networks like bit torrent searches for neighbour and then their neighbour for content
4. Social Networking Search , if person is immediate friend then it will be shown first, then their friends etc.
5. Garbage collection, unreachable data are deleted
6. Cycle detection , dfs can also be used
7. Broadcasting
8. Ford Fulkerson Algorithm

Applications of DFS:

1. Cycle Detection  
2. Topological Sorting // Makefile Utility
3. Strongly Connected Components 
4. Solving Maze and Similar Puzzle // dfs preferred because you don't have to go for each child node, backtracking algorithms also work with this approach.
				   // if we find a solution, then print it otherwise see for next child 
5. Path  Finding // natural in case of dfs because all path nodes are in recursion call stack
